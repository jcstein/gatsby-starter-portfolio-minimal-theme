ðŸŽ“ I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business concentrating in Supply Chain Management and Analytics from VCU's School of Business and a Minor of Mathematics in May 2021.

ðŸ¥¬  What am I passionate about? Reducing food waste to preserve our home planet and ensure every person can eat the meals they need to survive on it.
